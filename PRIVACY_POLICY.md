# Privacy Policy — Wikiflix

Last updated: 2026-01-06

1. Summary
-	Wikiflix is a frontend-only application that does not require user accounts. The app does not collect personal data for operation by default.

2. Data We Collect
-	Local data: user preferences and cached catalog (search index, embeddings and retrieved metadata) are stored locally on the device (LocalStorage on web, app private storage for mobile).
-	No analytics, no tracking, and no advertising are enabled by default. If you (or a future release) enable optional telemetry or analytics, that will be documented and users will be asked to opt‑in.

3. Third‑party content and services
-	Wikiflix displays and embeds content hosted by third parties (Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, Vimeo, Libreflix, Internet Archive). When you view such content those third parties may collect data (cookies, IP address, usage metrics) according to their own policies. We are not responsible for third‑party privacy practices — consult the provider's privacy policy.

4. Permissions
-	The app requests only the permissions it needs. On web builds no runtime permissions are required. On mobile, any permission requested (storage, camera, microphone, etc.) will be explicitly declared in the store listing and here.

5. Crash reports & analytics
-	By default there is no crash reporting or analytics enabled. If a future release integrates a crash-reporting or analytics provider we will list the provider, the type of data collected (stack traces, device model, OS version) and provide an opt‑out mechanism.

6. Data retention & deletion
-	All data stored by the app is local to your device. To remove local data you can clear the app cache (when available in-app) or uninstall the app. The static catalog files downloaded or copied to the app's storage can be removed by the user.

7. Security
-	We follow best practices to protect local data. Local storage is not transmitted to our servers. However, no system is perfectly secure; treat sensitive information accordingly.

8. Children
-	The app is not directed to children under 13. If the app is used by children, parental supervision is recommended.

9. Changes to this policy
-	We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will show the most recent revision.
